# Background
ZipChat is a video chat app powered by WebRTC. Traditional video calling apps use a forwarding server to send video/audio streams to other connected users. However WebRTC establishes a direct connection to each callee, allowing byte streams to be sent directly to the user in the call without the need for server intervention.

WebRTC is a communication protocol that establishes a direct connection to its peer instead of routing data through a server, hence the term 'decentralised'.
